<p>Refinery was a project supported by the Knight Foundation's prototype fund to build an NLP web application that simplifies the use of complicated NLP tools in an easy to use web interface. For the analysis of large document corpuses, Refinery provides a simple drag and drop interface along with interactive visualizations that help provide intuitive insights into your data.</p>

<a id="how-is-it-built" class="anchor" href="#how-is-it-built" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How is it built?</h3>

<p>Refinery is deployed locally using Vagrant (tested on v1.8.1) and VirtualBox (tested on v5.0). The application is highly scalable and capable of processing large document corpuses due to a Bayesian nonparametric toolbox BNPy built around the latest advances for scalable inference in types of models. Refinery can be considered a general tool for quickly discovering a set of topics which can then be leveraged to quickly isolate and extract insights into relevant documents. </p>

<p>Refinery is a browser driven web application built primarily off of Python. It was developed with the requirement that its implementation process be as simple as possible. Refinery requires three main packages - Git, Virtualbox, and Vagrant VM. Git is needed to clone the repository that will contain the main source code. VirtualBox and Vagrant VM allows Refinery to exist within a virtual machine that is accessible through your browser. The Vagrant package allows for the deployment of a Puppet manifest, which enables the automated installation of a large number of necessary software modules. To modify the installation process, the configuration file <strong>VagrantFile</strong> located within the root directory contains settings that help guide this process. Installation of Refinery is as follows from the command line:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/daeilkim/refinery.git
vagrant up
</code></pre>

<p>For machine learning, Refinery uses the BNPy package <a href="https://bitbucket.org/michaelchughes/bnpy-dev/">(BNPy Git Repository)</a>. The backend is supported by a PostgreSQL database used to store document corpuses and Redis for the pub/sub messaging framework used to see realtime updates. The web application is built on Python Flask, Gunicorn, Celery, and Nginx.</p>

<a id="troubleshooting-refinery" class="anchor" href="#troubleshooting-refinery" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Troubleshooting Refinery</h3>

<p>Most installation issues often are a result of outdated Vagrant links to Ubuntu images. The software was last checked to be functional as of 3/5/2016. Please contact <a href="https://github.com/daeilkim" class="user-mention">@daeilkim</a> if there are any installation issues.</p>
